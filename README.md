### Installation

The easiest and recommended way to install `birdy` is from [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/birdy)

```python
pip install birdy
```

### Usage

Import the client and initialize it:

```python
from birdy.twitter import UserClient
client = UserClient(CONSUMER_KEY,
                    CONSUMER_SECRET,
                    ACCESS_TOKEN,
                    ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET)
```

GET example (**GET users/show**):

```python
response = client.api.users.show.get(screen_name='twitter')
response.data
```

POST example (**POST statuses/update**):

```pyhton
response = client.api.statuses.update.post(status='Hello @pybirdy!')
```

Dynamic URL example (**POST statuses/destroy/:id**):

```python
response = client.api.statuses.destroy['240854986559455234'].post()
```

Streaming API example (**Public Stream POST statuses/filter**):

```python
response = client.stream.statuses.filter.post(track='twitter')

for data in response.stream():
    print data
```

## Supported Python version

`birdy` works with both `python2` (2.7+) and `python3` (3.4+).

## Why another Python Twitter API client? Aren't there enough?

The concept behind `birdy` is so simple and awesome that it just had to be done. The result is a super light weight and easy to use API client, that covers the whole Twitter REST API in just a little under 400 lines of code.

To achieve this, `birdy` relies on established, battle-tested Python libraries like `requests` and `requests-ouathlib` to do the heavy lifting. But more importantly it relies on Python's dynamic nature to automatically construct API calls (no individual wrapper functions for API resources needed). This allows `birdy` to cover all existing Twitter API resources and any future additions, without the need to update `birdy` itself.

Includes full support for both **OAuth1** (user) and **OAuth2** (application) authentication workflows.

Finally, `birdy` is simple and explicit by design. Besides error handling and JSON decoding it doesn't process the returned data in any way. That is left for you to handle. (Who'd know better what to do with it?!)

## OK, I'm sold. But how do I use it? How does this dynamic API construction work?

The easiest way to show you is by example. Let's say you want to query Twitter for @twitter user information. The Twitter API resource for this is **GET users/show** ([Twitter docs](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1/get/users/show)).

First you will need to import a client. Here we import UserClient (OAuth1) and than initialize it.

```python
from birdy.twitter import UserClient
client = UserClient(CONSUMER_KEY,
                    CONSUMER_SECRET,
                    ACCESS_TOKEN,
                    ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET)
```

To query the **GET /users/show** API resource and pass in the parameter screen\_name='twitter' you do this.

```python
resource = client.api.users.show
response = resource.get(screen_name='twitter')
```

What happens here is very simple. `birdy` translates the `users.show` part after `client.api` into the appropriate API resource path (**'users/show'**). Then when you call get() on the resource, `birdy` constructs a full resource URL, appends any parameters passed to get() to it and makes a GET request to that URL and returns the result.

Usually the above example would be shortened to just one line like this.

```python
response = client.api.users.show.get(screen_name='twitter')
```

Making a post request is similar. If for example, you would like to post a status update, this is how to do it. The API resource is **POST statuses/update** ([Twitter docs](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1/post/statuses/update)).

```python
response = client.api.statuses.update.post(status='Hello @pybirdy!')
```

Like before, the part after `client.api` gets converted to the correct path, only this time post() is called instead of get(), so `birdy` makes a POST request and passes parameters (and files) as part of the request body.

For cases when dynamic values are part of the API resource URL, like when deleting a tweet at **POST statuses/destroy/:id** ([Twitter docs](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1/post/statuses/destroy/:id)), `birdy` supports an alternative, dictionary lookup like syntax. For example, deleting a tweet with id '240854986559455234' looks like this.

``` python
response = client.api.statuses.destroy['240854986559455234'].post()
```

By now it should be clear what happens above. `birdy` builds the API resource path and then makes a POST request. The only difference is that part of the API path is provided like a dictionary key lookup.

Actually, any call can be written in this alternative syntax. Use whichever you prefer. Both syntax forms can be freely combined as in the example above. Some more examples:

```python
response = client.api['users/show'].get(screen_name='twitter')

response = client.api['users']['show'].get(screen_name='twitter')

response = client.api['statuses/destroy']['240854986559455234'].post()
```

### Is Streaming API supported as well?

Sure! Since version 0.2 `birdy` comes with full support for Streaming API out of the box. Access to the Streaming API is provided by a special `StreamClient`.

> `StreamClient` can't be used to obtain access tokens, but you can use `UserClient` to get them.

To work with the Streaming API, first import the client and initialize it.

```python
from birdy.twitter import StreamClient
client = StreamClient(CONSUMER_KEY,
                    CONSUMER_SECRET,
                    ACCESS_TOKEN,
                    ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET)
```

To access resources on the **Public** stream, like **POST statuses/filter** ([Twitter docs](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1/post/statuses/filter))

```python
resource = client.stream.statuses.filter.post(track='twitter')
```

For **User** stream resource **GET user** ([Twitter docs](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1/get/user))

```python
resource = client.userstream.user.get()
```

And for **Site** stream resource **GET site** ([Twitter docs](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1/get/site))

```python
resource = client.sitestream.site.get()
```

To access the data in the stream you iterate over `resource.stream()` like this

```python
for data in resource.stream():
   print data
```

## Great, what about authorization? How do I get my access tokens?

`birdy` supports both **OAuth1** and **OAuth2** authentication workflows by providing two different clients, a `UserClient` and `AppClient` respectively. While requests to API resources, like in above examples are the same in both clients, the workflow for obtaining access tokens is slightly different.

> Before you get started, you will need to [register](https://dev.twitter.com/apps) your application with Twitter, to obtain your application's `CONSUMER_KEY` and `CONSUMER_SECRET`.

### OAuth1 workflow for user authenticated requests (UserClient)

#### Step 1: Creating a client instance

First you need to import the `UserClient` and create an instance with your apps `CONSUMER_KEY` and `CONSUMER_SECRET`.

```python
from birdy.twitter import UserClient

CONSUMER_KEY = 'YOUR_APPS_CONSUMER_KEY'
CONSUMER_SECRET = 'YOUR_APPS_CONSUMER_SECRET'
CALLBACK_URL = 'https://127.0.0.1:8000/callback'

client = UserClient(CONSUMER_KEY, CONSUMER_SECRET)
```

#### Step 2: Get request token and authorization URL

> Pass `callback_url` only if you have a Web app. Desktop and Mobile apps **do not** require it.

Next you need to fetch request token from Twitter. If you are building a _Sign-in with Twitter_ type application it's done like this.

```python
token = client.get_signin_token(CALLBACK_URL)
```

Otherwise like this.

```python
token = client.get_authorize_token(CALLBACK_URL)
```

Save `token.oauth_token` and `token.oauth_token_secret` for later use, as these are not the final token and secret.

```python
ACCESS_TOKEN = token.oauth_token
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET = token.oauth_token_secret
```

Direct the user to the Twitter authorization URL obtained from `token.auth_url`.

#### Step 3: OAuth verification

> If you have a Desktop or Mobile app, `OAUTH_VERIFIER` is the PIN code. You can skip the part about extraction.

After authorizing your application on Twitter, the user will be redirected back to the `callback_url` provided during client initialization in *Step 1*.

You will need to extract the `OAUTH_VERIFIER` from the URL. Most web frameworks provide an easy way of doing this or you can parse the URL yourself using `urlparse` module (if that is your thing).

Django and Flask examples:

```python
#Django
OAUTH_VERIFIER = request.GET['oauth_verifier']

#Flask
OAUTH_VERIFIER = request.args.get('oauth_verifier')
```

Once you have the `OAUTH_VERIFIER` you can use it to obtain the final access token and secret. To do that you will need to create a new instance of `UserClient`, this time also passing in `ACCESS_TOKEN` and `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` obtained in *Step 2* and then fetch the tokens.

```python
client = UserClient(CONSUMER_KEY, CONSUMER_SECRET,
                    ACCESS_TOKEN, ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET)

token = client.get_access_token(OAUTH_VERIFIER)
```

Now that you have the final access token and secret, you can save `token.oauth_token` and `token.oauth_token_secret` to the database for later use. You can also use the client to start making API request immediately. For example, you can retrieve the user's home timeline like this.

```python
response = client.api.statuses.home_timeline.get()
response.data
```

That's it. You have successfully authorized the user, retrieved the tokens and can now make API calls on their behalf.

### OAuth2 workflow for app authenticated requests (AppClient)

#### Step 1: Creating a client instance

For OAuth2 you will be using the `AppClient`, so first you need to import it and create an instance with your apps `CONSUMER_KEY` and `CONSUMER_SECRET`.

```python
from birdy.twitter import AppClient

CONSUMER_KEY = 'YOUR_APPS_CONSUMER_KEY'
CONSUMER_SECRET = 'YOUR_APPS_CONSUMER_SECRET'

client = AppClient(CONSUMER_KEY, CONSUMER_SECRET)
```

#### Step 2: Getting the access token

OAuth2 workflow is much simpler compared to OAuth1. To obtain the access token you simply do this.

```python
access_token = client.get_access_token()
```

That's it. You can start using the client immediately to make API request on behalf of the app. It's recommended you save the `access_token` for later use. You initialize the client with a saved token like this.

```python
client = AppClient(CONSUMER_KEY, CONSUMER_SECRET, SAVED_ACCESS_TOKEN)
```

Keep in mind that OAuth2 authenticated requests are **read-only** and not all API resources are available. Check [Twitter docs](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1) for more information.

## Any other useful features I should know about?

Of course, `birdy` comes with some handy features to ease your development right out of the box. Let's take a look at some of the goodies.

### Automatic JSON decoding

JSON data returned by the REST and Streaming API is automatically decoded to native Python objects. No extra coding necessary, start using the data right away.

### JSONObject

When decoding JSON data, `objects` are, instead of a regular Python dictionary, converted to a `JSONObject`, which is dictionary subclass with attribute style access in addition to regular dictionary lookup style, for convenience. The following code produces the same result.

```python
followers_count = response.data['followers_count']

followers_count = response.data.followers_count
```

### ApiResponse

Calls to REST API resources return a `ApiResponse`, which in addition to returned data, also gives you access to response headers (useful for checking rate limits) and resource URL.

```python
response.data           # decoded JSON data
response.resource_url   # resource URL
response.headers        # dictionary containing response HTTP headers
```

### StreamResponse

`StreamResponse` is returned when calling Streaming API resources and provides the **stream()** method which returns an iterator used to receive JSON decoded streaming data. Like `ApiResponse` it also gives you access to response headers and resource URL.

```python
response.stream()       # a generator method used to iterate over the stream

for data in response.stream():
    print data
```

### Informative exceptions

There are 4 types of exceptions in `birdy`. They are all subclasses of the base class `BirdyException` (which is never directly raised).

- `TwitterClientError` raised for connection and access token retrieval errors
- `TwitterApiError` raised when Twitter returns an error
- `TwitterAuthError` raised when authentication fails,
- `TwitterApiError` subclass
- `TwitterRateLimitError` raised when rate limit for resource is reached, `TwitterApiError` subclass

`TwitterApiError` and `TwitterClientError` instances (except for access token retrieval errors) provide a informative error description which includes the resource URL and request method used (very handy when tracking errors in logs). Also available is the following:

```python
exception.request_method    # HTTP method used to make the request (GET or POST)
exception.resource_url      # URL of the API resource called
exception.status_code       # HTTP status code returned by Twitter
exception.error_code        # error code returned by Twitter
exception.headers           # dictionary containing response HTTP headers
```

### Customize and extend through subclassing

`birdy` was built with subclassing in mind. If you wish to change the way it works, all you have to do is subclass one of the clients and override some methods and you are good to go.

> Subclassing a client and then using the subclass instance in your code is actually **the recommended way** of using `birdy`.

For example, if you don't wish to use `JSONObject` you have to override **get\_json\_object\_hook()** method.

```python
from birdy.twitter import UserClient

class MyClient(UserClient):
    @staticmethod
    def get_json_object_hook(data):
        return data

client = MyClient(...)
response = client.api.users.show.get(screen_name='twitter')
```

Or maybe, if you want global error handling for common errors, just override **handle\_response()** method.

```python
class MyClient(UserClient):
    def handle_response(self, method, response):
        try:
            response = super(MyClient, self).handle_response(method, response)
        except TwitterApiError, e:
            ...
            # Your error handling code
            ...
        return response
```

Another use of subclassing is configuration of `requests.Session` instance ([docs](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/api/#sessionapi)) used to make HTTP requests. To configure it, you override the **configure\_oauth\_session()** method.

```python
class MyClient(UserClient):
    def configure_oauth_session(self, session):
        session = super(MyClient, self).configure_oauth_session(session)
        session.proxies = {'http': 'foo.bar:3128'}
    return session
```
